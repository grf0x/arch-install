# Arch Installation Script  

My installation script for Arch Linux. Only one password entry is needed to start the installation. Possibility to create multiple profiles based on needs.

## Installation 

From archiso:

``` bash
loadkeys fr
mount --mkdir /dev/sdb3 arch
bash arch/install profile_name
```
